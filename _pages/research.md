## projects

**Breaking Robust Adversarial Classification (retrieve [here](/files/CS838ProjectReport.pdf))**
_Spring 2018_
_Under Prof. Dimitris Papailiopoulos, UW-Madison_
* Robust Manifold Defense is state-of-the-art adversarial classification algorithm which works by projecting on the space of GANs
* Developed the first algorithm to break the classifier & brought down the classification accuracy by 35% (more work in progress)

**Fuzzy Iterative Machine Teaching (retrieve [here](/files/CS861ProjectReport.pdf))**
_Spring 2018_
_Under Prof. Jerry Zhu, UW-Madison_
* Studied the inverse problem of ML--Machine Teaching--where the aim is to learn a target parameter vector in minimum steps
* Derived robust bounds for the minimum steps needed to converge under noisy and missing data settings for different losses

**Autoencoders & Generative Adversarial Modeling**
_Spring 2018_
_Under Prof. Rebecca Willett, UW-Madison_
* Implemented autoencoders and generative adversarial nets for MRI image denoising
* Worked on a unique approach to invert a neural network using Neumann series in operator space

**GPU profiling of Deep learning frameworks (retrieve [here](/files/cs744_project_poster.pptx))**
_Fall 2017_
_Under Prof. Aditya Akella, UW-Madison_
* Analyzed deep learning libraries using their intermediate representations (with ONNX) and profiled their GPU performances

**Effect of Segmentation and Encoding on Machine Translation**
_2016 - 2017_
_Under Prof. Pushpak Bhattacharyya, IIT Bombay_
* Improved transliteration and translation with use of pivot-based modeling, byte-pair encoding and orthographic syllabification
* Paper published at IJCNLP 2017 (retrieve [here](http://aclweb.org/anthology/I17-2048))

**Statistical Shape Analysis of Images (retrieve [here](/files/UndergradThesis1.pdf) and [here](/files/UndergradThesis2.pdf))**
_2016 - 2017_
_Under Prof. Suyash Awate, IIT Bombay_
* Created a similarity measure between images and their contours alongside a novel objective function
* Used that to segment MRI images (with a shape prior) by performing Riemannian PCA on high dimensional unit spheres
