### me
i am pradyot, a software engineer working on automated speech recognition at facebook. i work on making our assistant "portal" better at recognizing speech signals alongside improving facebook's video captioning.

prior to this, i spent some amazing time in the beautiful city of madison, wisconsin working on my master's in computer science. i graduated with a bachelors in computer science and engineering after spending 4 lovely years as an undergrad at the indian institute of technology bombay.

my master's thesis was with with [prof. dimitris papailiopoulos](http://papail.io/) working on the intersection of adversarial modeling and coding theory. i assisted [prof. jason fletcher](https://ssc.wisc.edu/~jfletcher/Website/www/ "jason fletcher") as a research assistant. we applied ml models to population datasets to make real-world predictive analysis and suggest policy changes. i worked under [prof. rebecca willett](https://voices.uchicago.edu/willett/) recently on the more theoretical aspects of ml.

i love cooking (especially baking) and working out in my free time. recently i have been learning how to professionally kickbox.
