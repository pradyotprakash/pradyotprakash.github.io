### me
i am pradyot, a second year master's student in the [computer sciences](http://cs.wisc.edu) department at uw-madison located in the beautiful city of madison (obviously!). i graduated with a bachelors in computer science and engineering after spending 4 lovely years as an undergrad at the indian institute of technology bombay.

i spent the summer of 2018 interning at **facebook** in their menlo park office. my work involved experimenting with the prediction models used within ads product ranking to improve the product placement on the feed. one of my models is **currently in production and serving ads traffic globally**.

i am currently working with [prof. dimitris papailiopoulos](http://papail.io/) at the intersection of adversarial modeling and coding theory (and probably some reinforcement learning) towards my masters' thesis. i also assist [prof. jason fletcher](https://ssc.wisc.edu/~jfletcher/Website/www/ "jason fletcher") as a research assistant. we apply ml models to population datasets to make real-world predictive analysis and suggest policy changes. i worked with [prof. rebecca willett](https://voices.uchicago.edu/willett/) recently on the more theoretical aspects of ml.

i love cooking (especially baking) and working out in my free time.

### interests
machine learning, computer vision
