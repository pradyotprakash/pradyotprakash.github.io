### me
i am pradyot, a first year graduate student in the [computer sciences](http://cs.wisc.edu) department at uw-madison located in the beautiful city of madison (obviously!). i graduated with a bachelors in computer science and engineering after spending 4 lovely years as an undergrad at the indian institute of technology bombay.

i am currently assisting [prof. jason fletcher](https://ssc.wisc.edu/~jfletcher/Website/www/ "jason fletcher") as a research assistant. we use ml models to population datasets to make real-world predictive analysis and suggest policy changes. i have started working with [prof. rebecca willett](https://willett.ece.wisc.edu "rebecca willett") recently on the more theoretical aspects of ml.

i love cooking (especially baking) and am struggling to learn ice skating.

### interests
machine learning, optimization
