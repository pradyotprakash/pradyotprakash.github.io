### me
i am pradyot, an engineer working on application of machine learning to health tech for improving human health outcomes. i worked on speech recognition earlier.

prior to this, i spent some amazing time in the beautiful city of madison, wisconsin working on my master's in computer science. i graduated with a bachelors in computer science and engineering after spending 4 lovely years as an undergrad at the indian institute of technology bombay.

i love cooking (especially baking) and working out in my free time. recently i have been learning how to professionally kickbox.
